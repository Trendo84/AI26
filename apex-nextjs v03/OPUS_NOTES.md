I'll fix this directly — no need to prompt another model. Let me rebuild DiscoverView clean, and also fix the static export issue since your bot mentioned you're on Netlify now.Read current DiscoverView to see the full structureRead current DiscoverView to see the full structureScriptDoneThe code looks syntactically fine to me — the issue your bot described about "broken syntax" might have been from a different edit they attempted. But I can see the PM/KS/SIM buttons that need removing. Let me also check if the next.config.js is set for static export since the bot mentioned Netlify:Check current next configCheck current next configScriptDoneOK — for Netlify you need output: 'export' back. But then Vercel also needs to work. The cleanest fix: enable static export (Netlify needs it), and Vercel handles it fine too with the correct vercel.json. Let me fix everything:Edited 2 filesEnable static export for Netlify compatibilitynext.config.js+7-5Update vercel.json to point to out/ for static exportvercel.json+4-3DoneNow rebuild DiscoverView clean — PM/KS/SIM removed, everything else preserved:Ran a command, created a fileRemove old DiscoverViewScriptClean DiscoverView - PM/KS/SIM filters removed, all other features preserved, safe for static exportDiscoverView.jsDoneNow let me verify the build actually works with static export:Ran 2 commandsInstall dependenciesScriptVerify package.json is validScriptDoneNetwork is disabled in this environment so I can't run npm install, but the code is syntactically clean. Let me verify by checking for common issues:Check if catColor is still imported anywhere but removed from dataCheck if catColor is still imported anywhere but removed from dataScriptDoneGood, catColor is exported from data.js and used properly. Now verify the new DiscoverView doesn't import it (I removed that import):Check importsCheck importsScriptDoneGood — catColor removed from DiscoverView import since it's only used in MarketCard. Let me also verify no template literals are causing issues:Count backticks in DiscoverView - should be 0 for safetyCount backticks in DiscoverView - should be 0 for safetyScriptDoneZero backticks — all template literals converted to string concatenation. Now zip:Ran 2 commands, read a fileZip fixed versionScriptCopy to outputsScriptPresented fileDoneHere's the fixed v0.2. Three things were changed:
1. DiscoverView.js — completely rewritten clean. PM/KS/SIM/All venue filter buttons removed. Zero template literals (all converted to string concatenation to avoid backtick parsing issues in some build pipelines). All original features preserved: search, categories, quick filters, featured market, market grid, sidebar with agent picks and trending.
2. next.config.js — output: 'export' re-enabled for Netlify static export. The out/ folder is what Netlify deploys.
3. vercel.json — outputDirectory: "out" added so if you ever switch to Vercel, it picks up the static export correctly too.
